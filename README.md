# Router MAC Address Generator

This application provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for generating MAC addresses that mimic those of popular router manufacturers like Cisco, NETGEAR, TP-Link, and others. It's built using Python and PyQt5.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the application, you need to have Python installed on your computer. Python 3.6 or higher is recommended. You also need to install PyQt5, which can be done via pip.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository or download the source code:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JPShag/RTMAC.git
   cd RTMAC
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you will see a window with a button labeled "Generate MAC Address". Clicking this button will generate a new MAC address based on real-world OUIs associated with router manufacturers and display it in the window.

## Features

- **Simple GUI**: Easy-to-use graphical interface.
- **Realistic MAC Addresses**: Generates MAC addresses using OUIs of actual router manufacturers.
